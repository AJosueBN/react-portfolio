# REACT-PORTFOLIO

This portfolio is based around projects that I have created or collaborated on, using the React skills I've learned to use the latest and updated technologies.

Built a single-page reloaded application with project samples and other relevant details within the webpage.

The technologies that have been involved in this project include CSS, JavaScript and React

Instructions on how to use React further can be found on [React Guidelines](https://github.com/AJosueBN/react-portfolio/blob/main/public/react-guidelines/README.md) section.
